** Intake PDFs: 
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake.pdf
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake_with_remarks.pdf

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figures. 
   47 total. (46 are informal; 1 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master

Notes from Dan:
==================

This book is ready for intake. 

The Foreword is rendering as a Chapter.

[Fixed. --Tools]

The Preface opens with a quote and attribution, but they're not styled correctly. Actually, this is true of other epigraphs throughout.

[Fixed. --Tools]

See the note about Figure captions from Meg. The authors claim to have included them, but I don't see them. 

[The authors may think that the alt text is the caption. Check out the text in the brackets for each figure and perhaps confirm with them. --Tools ]

Prod: please ask copyeditor to suggest callouts for all figures and such. Also, ask her to watch for stacked headlines and ask the 
authors to insert text to avoid them.

*A figure under "The Development Environment" isn't rendering.

[Fixed. --Tools]

Watch for long code lines. 

Watch figure sizes. Some look too big.

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Chris
